--- localhost version of chat application ----
1. In terms of getting the chatroom application to run locally, you will need to download the files that will be labeled “localhost”. 
2. Once these files are placed into a folder in a directory of your choosing, open your IDE of choice and go open that folder in your IDE. 
3. Once there, open a terminal and install node.js/npm. 
4. You will have to go to the node.js website as labeled by nodejs.org/en/download/ and you will need to download the node files under the Operating System you are using. 
5. You can verify these are installed correctly by running the commands “node -v” and “npm -v”. 
6. Socket.io is already included in our source in the .ejs files so you don’t need to worry about that. 
7. Now you can run the application locally by opening a terminal in your IDE and typing “npm run devStart”. 
8. Then you will open a browser of your choosing and you will type “localhost:3000/”. 
9. You should see the application running and now you can start to mess with the functionality included within the chatrooms.
